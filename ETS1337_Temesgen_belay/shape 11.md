the pseudo-code for the algorithm 

step 1 start 
step 2 the outer loop Starts from rows (6) and decrements to 1.Controls the number of rows.
step 3 the inner loop prints i stars in each row.A space (" ") is added after each * for separation.
step 4 the inner loop Prints spaces before the * in each row.The number of spaces increases as the row number decreases.
step 5 print the result 
step 6 end
