the algorithm for checking weather a number is perfect or not is 
stage 1 problem analysis 
input 
number from the user 
process 
checking weather the the number is the divisor of the given number and add the divisors 
check if the sum is equal to the original number ornot 
output 
the number is perfect or the number is not perfect 

stage 2 pseuo-code 
step 1 start 
step 2 read the input from the user 
step 3 ckeck weather the number is the divisor of the number or not 
step 4 if it is, add the divisors and compare the sum of the divisors to the number enterd by the user 
step 5 if they are equal the number is perfect other ways it is not perfect 
step 6 priting the result 
step 7 end
