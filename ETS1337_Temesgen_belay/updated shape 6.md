the pseuso-code for the algorithm 

step 1 start 
step 2 the outer loop Controls the number of rows in the pattern.it starts from 0 and goes up to 4 (total 5 iterations).
step 3 the inner loop Controls the number of columns in each row.it  starts from 0 and goes up to 4 (total 5 iterations).
step 4 (char)('a' + j) converts the result of 'a' + j to a character.
step 5 print the result and new line 
step 6 end 




// to allow the user to input dimension
step 1 start 
step 2 reading inputs for rows and columns from the user 
step 3 make the number of rows and columns enterd by user for the condition for the outer and the inner loop respectively 
step 4 print the result 
step 5 end
