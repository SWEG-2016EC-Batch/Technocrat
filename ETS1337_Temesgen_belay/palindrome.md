the algorithm for checking wheather the numebr is palindrome or not 
stage 1 teh problem analysis 
input 
number from the user
process 
checking weather it is palindrome or not 
output
displaying the result of the checking(yes it is palindrome or not palindrome)
stage 2 the pseuo-code
step 1 start 
step 2 reading input 
step 3 storing the original number in other variable and reverse its digit,
