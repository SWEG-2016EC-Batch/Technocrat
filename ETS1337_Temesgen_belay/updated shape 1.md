the pseudo-code for the algorithm 
step 1 start 
step 2 initialize outer loop to 0 and the inner to 1 
step 3 the maximum value for the outer loop is 4 and 5 for the inner 
step 4 print the inner loop 
step 5 new line after the inner loop is iterated 
step 6 end 


// to allow the user to input dimension
step 1 start 
step 2 reading inputs for rows and columns from the user 
step 3 make the number of rows and columns enterd by user the condition for the outer and the inner loop respectively 
step 4 print the result 
step 5 end
