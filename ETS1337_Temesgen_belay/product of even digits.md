the algorithm for finding the product of even digits that exists in a given number 
stage 1 the problem analysis 
input 
number from the user 
process 
checking weather even digit in a given number exist of not 
if exist compute their product 
output 
displaying the result if even digit exist or not exist message if their is no even number in a given digit 
stage 2 the pseudo-code
step 1 start 
step 2 reading input from the user 
step 3 finding the modulo of the number and storing it 
step 4 checking the modulo of a number is even or not , if it is even update the variable for storing the multiplication result 
step 5 printing the result or there is no even number 
step 6 end
