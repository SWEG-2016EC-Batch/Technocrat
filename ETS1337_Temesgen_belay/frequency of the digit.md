the algorithm for finding the frequency of the digit 
stage 1 problem analysis 
input 
number from the user 
process 
counting the frequency of the digit 
output 
dispalying their frequency 

stage 2 the pseudo-code 
step 1 start 
step 2 reading input from the user
step 3 counting the frequency of each digit that exit with in a number 
step 4 displaying their frequency 
step 5 end
