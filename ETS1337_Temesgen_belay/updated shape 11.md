the pseudo-code for the algorithm 

step 1 start 
step 2 the outer loop Starts from rows (6) and decrements to 1.Controls the number of rows.
step 3 the inner loop prints i stars in each row.A space (" ") is added after each * for separation.
step 4 the inner loop Prints spaces before the * in each row.The number of spaces increases as the row number decreases.
step 5 print the result 
step 6 end 



// to allow the user to input dimension
step 1 start 
step 2 reading inputs for rows  
step 3 make the number of rows the maximum value of the outer loop 
step 4 print the result 
step 5 end
