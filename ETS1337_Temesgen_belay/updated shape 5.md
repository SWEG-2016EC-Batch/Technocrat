the pseudo-code for the algorithm 

step 1 start 
step 2 the outer loop Controls the number of rows in the pattern. it starts from 1 and goes up to 5, meaning the pattern will have 5 rows.
step 3 the inner loop Controls the number of columns in each row. For each row , it prints characters equal to the outer loop
step 4 update the character 
step 5 prints the result and new line 
step 6 end 


// to allow the user to input dimension
step 1 start 
step 2 reading inputs for rows  
step 3 make the number of rows the maximum value of the outer loop 
step 4 print the result 
step 5 end
