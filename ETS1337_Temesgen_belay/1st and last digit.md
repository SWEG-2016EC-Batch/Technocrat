input 
reading input 
process 
finding the 1st and last digits 
the sum of the 1st and last digits 
output 
1st and last digit of the given number
sum the the above digits 
stage 2 the pseudo-code
step 1 start 
step 2 reading input from the user 
step 3 storing the last digit by finding the modulo of the given number 
step 4 initalizing the varaible to store the 1st digit with the number and finding the 1st digit by continuously dividing the number by 10
step 5 displaying the this digits along with their sum
