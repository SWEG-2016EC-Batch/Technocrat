the pseudo-code for the algorithm 

step 1 start 
step 2 the outer loop now runs 7 times, creating 7 rows.
step 3 the inner loop now runs 8 times, creating 8 columns.
step 4 Ensures * is printed on only at the boundaries 
step 5 print the result 
step 6 end 


// to allow the user to input dimension
step 1 start 
step 2 reading inputs for rows and columns from the user 
step 3 make the number of rows and columns enterd by user the condition for the outer and the inner loop respectively 
step 4 print the result 
step 5 end
