//Write a program that find the result of the expression x^y where the value of X and Y are entered by the user.
The Algorithm for the above problem:
stage 1 Problem analyis 
input 
Base (x): A number entered by the user.
Exponent (y): Another number entered by the user.
process 
use  the POW function to compute x^y.
Output 
The result of x^y(x raised to the power of y) 
Stage 2 Pseudocode 
step 1 start 
step 2 read the base as x and exponent as y 
step 3 perform the desired(x raised to y) mathimatical operation 
step 4 print the result 
step 5 end
