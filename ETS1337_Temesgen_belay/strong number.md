the algorithm for finding weather a number is strong or not is 
stage 1 problem analysis 
input 
number  from the user 
process 
finding the factorial for each digit and adding them then checking if it is equal or not with the orignal number 
output 
priting that a number is  strong or not 

stage 2 the pseudo-code 
step 1 start 
step 2 reading input from the user
step 3 finding the factorial for each digit and add the their factorial 
step 4 comaparing the sum of the factorial of the digit with the original number 
step 5 if it is equal then the number is strong but if not the number is not strong 
step 6 end
