//the algorithm for finding the reverse of a number is:
stage 1 problem analysis 
input 
number from the user 
process 
finding the reverse of a number 
output 
the reversed number 
stage 2 
the Pseudo-code 
step 1 start
step 2 reading input 
step 3 finding the modulo of a number and store it on a variable 
step 4 updating the number 
step 5 updating the variable that store the reverse of a number 
step 6 printing the output 
step 7 end
