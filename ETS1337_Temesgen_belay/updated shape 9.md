the pseudo-code for the algorithm 

step 1 start 
step 2 the outer loop Controls the number of rows.Starts with i = 6 and decreases until i > 0.
step 3 the inner loop Controls the number of columns in each row.Each row has i columns.
step 4 Ensures that * is printed only on the boundaries 
step 5 print the output 
step 6 end 


// to allow the user to input dimension
step 1 start 
step 2 reading inputs for rows  
step 3 make the number of rows the maximum value of the outer loop 
step 4 print the result 
step 5 end
