the pseudo-code of the algorithm 

step 1 start 
step 2 the outer loop Controls the number of rows.it starts with 6 and decreases until > 0.
step 3 the inner loop Controls the number of stars (*) in each row.Prints i stars in each row, where i corresponds to the current row number.
step 4 print the result and new line 
step 5 end 


// to allow the user to input dimension
step 1 start 
step 2 reading inputs for rows  
step 3 make the number of rows the maximum value of the outer loop 
step 4 print the result 
step 5 end
