problem analysis
     input
        1.transmission rate of a serial transmission line as a constant which is 960
        2.file size as a constant which is 400 MB
     output
        1.time required to transmit the file by the serial transmission line 






pseudocode
   1.start
   2.compute time elapsed to transmit the file by using the serial transmission line as time_in _seconds = transmission rate * file size
   3.display time_in _seconds
   4.stop
