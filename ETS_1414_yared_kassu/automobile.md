PROBLEM ANALYSIS:

input: 

capacity of the fuel tank

miles per galon a car traveles

output:

number of miles a car can be driven without refueling

process:

compute number of miles to be driven with out 
 Refueling using the formula (m) m/g*g

PSEUDOCODE:


 Number of miles driven with out refueling 
 
Step 1: start 

Step 2:read capacity of fuel tank(g) and miles/gallon to Be driven (m/g) 

Step 3:compute number of miles to be driven with out 
 Refueling (m) m/g*g

Step 4:print number of miles (m)

Step 5:stop
