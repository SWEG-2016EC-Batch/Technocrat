PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
The program calculates the number of miles an automobile can travel without refueling. It takes the tank capacity (in gallons) and the miles per gallon (fuel efficiency) as inputs and calculates the total miles the car can travel
Input:

Tank capacity (in gallons) — an integer value.
Miles per gallon — an integer value representing the fuel efficiency.
Process

Read the tank capacity.
Read the miles per gallon.
Calculate the total miles the automobile can travel using the formula:
No of Miles
=
Tank Capacity
×
Miles Per Gallon
No of Miles=Tank Capacity×Miles Per Gallon
Output:

Total miles the automobile can travel without refueling.


ALGORITHM USING PSUEODOCODE:

Start Program:

Display "Input the tank capacity in gallons:"
Input tank_capacity

Display "Input the miles per gallon the automobile goes:"
Input miles_per_gallon

Calculate no_of_miles = tank_capacity * miles_per_gallon

Display "The miles your automobile can go without refueling is:", no_of_miles

End Program:
