1. Start

2. Set the number of rows (`rows`) to 5

3. Initialize a loop variable `i` to 1

4. Repeat the following steps while `i` is less than or equal to `rows`:

    a. Initialize a loop variable `j` to 1

    b. Repeat the following steps while `j` is less than or equal to `rows - i`:

        i. Print "  " (two spaces for alignment)

        ii. Increment `j` by 1

    c. Initialize another loop variable `j` to 1

    d. Repeat the following steps while `j` is less than or equal to `2 * i - 1`:

        i. Print "* " (an asterisk followed by a space)

        ii. Increment `j` by 1

    e. Print a newline character to move to the next row

    f. Increment `i` by 1

5. End
