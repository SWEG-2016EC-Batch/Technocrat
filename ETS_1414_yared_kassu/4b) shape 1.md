pseudocode:


1. Start

2. Set the number of rows (`rows`) to 5 and columns (`cols`) to 7

3. Initialize a loop variable `i` to 1

4. Repeat the following steps while `i` is less than or equal to `rows`:

    a. Initialize a loop variable `j` to 1

    b. Repeat the following steps while `j` is less than or equal to `cols`:

        i. If `i` is 1, or `i` is equal to `rows`, or `j` is 1, or `j` is equal to `cols`:

            - Print "* " (an asterisk followed by a space)

        ii. Otherwise:

            - Print "  " (two spaces)

        iii. Increment `j` by 1

    c. Print a newline character to move to the next row

    d. Increment `i` by 1

5. End
