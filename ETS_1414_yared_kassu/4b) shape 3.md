1. Start

2. Set the number of rows (`rows`) to 5

3. Initialize a loop variable `i` to `rows` (5)

4. Repeat the following steps while `i` is greater than or equal to 1:

    a. Initialize a loop variable `j` to 1

    b. Repeat the following steps while `j` is less than or equal to `i`:

        i. If `j` is 1, or `j` is equal to `i`, or `i` is equal to `rows`:

            - Print "* " (an asterisk followed by a space)
        ii. Otherwise:

            - Print "  " (two spaces)

        iii. Increment `j` by 1

    c. Print a newline character to move to the next row

    d. Decrement `i` by 1

5. End
