PROBLEM ANALYSIS ::
Problem Statement:
The program calculates the result of raising a number 
x (base) to the power y (exponent). Both values x and ùë¶
are entered by the user. The result is computed using the formula:

Result= x^y
Input Base
1) (x): A floating-point or integer number.
2) Exponent (y): A floating-point or integer number.

Process:
Prompt the user to enter the base (x).
Prompt the user to enter the exponent (y).
Use a power function or loop to calculate  X^Y
Display the result to the user.
OUTPUT:
the result of  X^Y

ALGORITHM USING PSEUDOCODE:
Start Program:
Display "Enter the base (x):"
Input x
Display "Enter the exponent (y):"
Input y
Calculate result = x raised to the power y using the formula result = pow(x, y)
Display "The result of", x, "raised to the power", y, "is:", result
End Program:
